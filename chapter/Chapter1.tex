\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

From its first occurrence in the early beginning of the 1980s until this very day, \textit{Human Immunodeficiency Viruses}, widely known as HIV, has taken 39 million lives.
Thanks to enhanced prevention and highly sophisticated medication, the brutality of the pandemic has been remarkably reduced since its peak in 2004.
Although, nowadays numerous antiretroviral treatment exist, aiming on inhibiting the viruses, patients suffers from strong side effects.
Optimally, the choice of kind and dose of drug has to be made individually for each patient.
However, finding the perfect medication by trial and error is cumbersome and painful.\\
This scientific report is not only concerned with finding a metric to quantify the efficiency of HIV treatments but also develops a systematic approach how to derive this efficiency measure individually for each patient.\\ \\
% Nevertheless, for a profound understanding of the HIV infection and its antiviral treatment on a long-term scale, further HIV studies are necessary.
For this, Adames et. al \cite{ADAMS200510} suggest to model the dynamics of the viruses under the effect of an antiretroviral treatment by the following set of non-linear ODEs (\textit{Ordinary Differential Equations}): 

\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \dot{T} &= \lambda - \rho T - (1 - \gamma(t))kTV\\
        \dot{T}^{*} &= (1-\gamma(t))kTV-\delta T^{*}\\
        \dot{V} &= N\delta T^{*}-cV \quad \text{.}
    \end{split}
    \label{equ:ODEs}
\end{align}

Although, HIV has more than one potential target cell\footnote{Target cells are cells that are infected by HIV, mainly the helper T cells such as CD4+ T cells or macrophages.} the above model considers only the population of one, denoted by $T$.
$T^*$ describe the infected target cells which actively produces free viruses $V$. 
Further $\lambda$ in $\frac{cells}{day\cdot ml}$ represents the rate at which new $T$ cells are created from sources within the body, $\rho$ in $\frac{1}{day}$ is the death rate of $T$ cells, $k$ in $\frac{ml}{virions\cdot day}$ the rate by which $T$ cells are infected by virus, $\delta$ in $\frac{1}{day}$ is the death rate for infected cells , $N$ the number of new virions produced from each of the infected cells during their lifetime, and finally $c$ in $\frac{1}{day}$ is the clearance rate of free virions. 
The time-varying parameter $\gamma(t) \in [0,1]$ quantifies the antiviral drug efficacy whose formal definition will not be given here.
A drug is said to be efficient if all viruses are inhibited, i.e. $\gamma(t) = 1$.
Only if this is the case, the ODEs \ref{equ:ODEs} can be solved analytically, otherwise numerically.
In the following, we will assume an imperfect inhibition and denote the numerical solution of the viral load by $\tilde{V}_j \approx V(t_j)$ at time $t_j$ (the considered time period is discretized in $N_t$ time steps).
Further, Huang et. al claim that if $\gamma(t) > e_c$ for all $t$ the virus will be eventually eradicated.
Thus, the so-called \textit{efficacy threshold} $e_c$, defined as

\begin{align}
 e_c = 1-\frac{c\rho}{kN}\lambda
 \label{equ:e_c}
\end{align}

can be interpreted as the ability of a patientâ€™s immune system to control viral replication.
For an optimized drug treatment it is important to know $e_c$ for each patient.
At the same time, only the viral load $V(t)$ can directly be measured in the blood plasma.
Hence, $e_c$ can only be retrieved by estimating the model parameters $\mathbf{m} = (c, \rho, k, N, \lambda)$ from the patient's clinical data  \cite{huang2003modeling}.\\
All in all, estimating the patient specific, discrete model parameter $\mathbf{m}$ is an inverse problem.
The associated forward problem is given by the set of equations \ref{equ:ODEs} which non-linearly relates the model parameter $\mathbf{m}$ to the observations $V_{obs}$.
