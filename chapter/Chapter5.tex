\section{The Results}
\label{sec:results}

% With the previously introduced methods to define and solve the inversion problem, one can finally derive the model parameters $\mathbf{m}$ which explain the observed viral load $V_{obs}$ the best.
% According to \ref{equ:e_c} the efficacy threshold of the patient for the considered antiretroviral treatment can be derived.
% Comparing this to $\gamma(t)$ directly reveals whether the chosen treatment is appropriate or not.\\
% All in all, the developed method allows a systematic approach how to derive the efficacy of a medicine and optimize the HIV treatment individually for each patient.
